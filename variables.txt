How can you declare a varaible in python:(Rules)	
1. It will be a collection of alphabets,digits and specail characters(_ underscore).
2. First letter should not be start with digits.
example: 1var = 20( it's incorrect)
3. But is should be start with underscore or alphabets, in the middle or end we can use digits
example: var_1 = 2(it's true)
         _var2 = 3(it's true)
         var3  = 1(it's true)
4. variable name is a case sensitive one(python is case sensitive i.e there is a difference b/w small and capital letters)
example: var1 =2 
         Var1 =2(both are not same, python treated as both are different variables.)
5. If you have multiple words of varaible name, its follow camel format( first is small, second word onwards capital )
 exapmle: myVariable =10
          myVaraValue =1
