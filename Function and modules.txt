Function: Nothing but there are stmts which grouped together to do a particular task.
or it is a piece of code executed by certain logic

-> There are built in functions are there, to know the all built in functions we used one command
   "  dir(__builtins__)  "
-> To know the  functionality of built in function we use  one command
    "  help(builtin function name)
   eg: help(max)

Modules:

     modules contains extra functionalities which can use whenever we want by includes them.
>For include that modules 
 import math (here math is a modules to use that module first we need to import it)
 math.functions (here we can call any function)
eg: math.sqrt
    math.sqrt(9)
o/p:3.0
Note : You can replace the built in function names in modules by the help of varaible name
   squareRoot = math.sqrt
   squareRoot(9)
O/P:3.0
